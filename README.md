# Kim's Pom Activity Tracker

We all love Kim. And we all love the enthusiasm he brings to poms. So while getting practice refactoring, we will celebrate our fun poms.

## Setup

- Clone this repository down
- `cd` into the repo, then run `git pull origin refactor-1`.
- Open up in your code editor and make sure you see the refactors that your instructor completed.

## Tasks

1. Identify the areas that a refactor would benefit this codebase.
2. An instructor will model a refactor of the buttons changing colors.
3. With your partner, refactor the `submitActivity` function so less code is repeated.
4. Extra Time? That date that's appearing on the card isn't too user friendly. Reformat that so instead of "2019-10-23", the user sees something like "Oct 23, 2019". Make sure this works for any date the user should select from that date input.
